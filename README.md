## Screenshots

Below are some screenshots demonstrating how the plugin works.

Users can set a number of days that the plugin should be patient with them as well as a number of days after which the
gloves come off ðŸ˜Š. Different "nag" messages appear depending on the time since the last post and the user's settings.
